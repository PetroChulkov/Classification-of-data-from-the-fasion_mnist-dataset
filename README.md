# Classification-of-data-from-the-fasion_mnist-dataset


--------

# Part 1
A convolutional neural network was created using Keras mechanisms, which classifies products from the fasion_mnist dataset.

--------

# Part 2
A convolutional neural network using VGG16 as a convolutional basis was created.
Trained the resulting network on data from the fasion_mnist dataset. During the training, additional training techniques and feature selection were used.
